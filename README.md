# `.tex` file decoder
A very simple `.tex` file decoder from games such as NERTS! Online, The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection, Last Call BBS, Exapunks, etc.

The decoder simply takes in a list of paths to `.tex` files and outputs a file in the same location appended with `.png`. Conversion from `.png` to `.tex` is not supported (yet).

## Supported Versions
The version is specified in the first 4 bytes of the file.
